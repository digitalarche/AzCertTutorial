Certified Cloud Security Professional (CCSP) Certification üôÇ

Before starting studying, you must know very well what this certification is about and what are the prerequisite

The topics included in the CCSP Common Body of Knowledge (CBK) ensure its relevancy across all disciplines
in the field of cloud security. Successful candidates are competent in the following 6 domains:
‚Äì Architectural Concepts & Design Requirements (19%)
‚Äì Cloud Data Security (20%)
‚Äì Cloud Platform & Infrastructure Security (19%)
‚Äì Cloud Application Security (15%)
‚Äì Operations (15%)
‚Äì Legal & Compliance (12%)

It is a 4 hours exam in front of a computer (and under video camera :))

There are 125 questions

The passing score is 700/1000

Depending on where you live, there are not so much people that have this certification. (ISC)2 issues counts of certificate holders every 6 months.

Mandatory to read before preparing and passing CCSP Exam : CCSP Exam Outline
Source : https://www.isc2.org/-/media/ISC2/Certifications/Exam-Outlines/CCSP-Exam-Outline.ashx

You will need between 40 to 60 hours to prepare correctly this exam (depending on your experience, knowledge‚Ä¶). Don‚Äôt underestimate the time necessary to study books, read white papers, search information and practice blank tests.

So if you spend 2 hours a day preparing, you can pass exam in one month.

I also strongly encourage to schedule your exam day before starting to study (because it will be easier to make a reverse planning)

There are 2 Official books that I think are mandatory to read :

CCSP (ISC)2 Certified Cloud Security Professional Official Study Guide : https://amzn.to/2uqQrQ5
CCSP Official (ISC) 2 Practice Tests : https://amzn.to/2Jg7t8E
The second book must be used only after reading the first one (that contains also some practice questions but more easier than the practice tests book)

Next you will find all my preparation notes, there are a lot of URL with a lot of additional content to read because everything is not in the official books ! I put also a package of documents in my Onedrive (https://1drv.ms/f/s!ApyDK_-MHwLvisVDZH1fx4OSWNItFw) if you want to download quicker a ‚Äúpackage of good papers to read‚Äù

FIPS 140-2 : NIST document that lists accredited and outmoded cryptosystems

‚Äî FIPS 140-2 Levels

FIPS-140-2 : The Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) Publication 140-2, (FIPS PUB 140-2) is a U.S. government computer security standard used to approve cryptographic modules.
The title is Security Requirements for Cryptographic Modules.
FIPS 140-2 defines four levels of security, simply named ‚ÄúLevel 1‚Äù to ‚ÄúLevel 4‚Äù
‚Äì Security Level 1 provides the lowest level of security : No specific physical security mechanisms are required in a Security Level 1 cryptographic module beyond the basic requirement for production-grade components
‚Äì Security Level 2 improves upon the physical security mechanisms of a Security Level 1 cryptographic module by requiring features that show evidence of tampering
‚Äì Security Level 3 attempts to prevent the intruder from gaining access to CSPs (Critical Security Parameter) held within the cryptographic module.
‚Äì Security Level 4 provides the highest level of security. At this security level, the physical security mechanisms provide a complete envelope of protection around the cryptographic module with the intent of detecting and responding to all unauthorized attempts at physical access. Penetration of the cryptographic module enclosure from any direction has a very high probability of being detected, resulting in the immediate deletion of all plaintext CSPs

Due care versus Due diligence :

‚Äì Due diligence is the act of gathering the necessary information so the best decision-making activities can take place.
due diligence requires that an organization continually scrutinize their own practices to ensure that they are always meeting or exceeding the requirements for protection of assets and stakeholders
This is something a company does prior to buying a service i.e. check the service provider is compliant in the areas they claim to be i.e. Are ISO27001 Certified ‚Äì not compliant.
Due Diligence is the assessment of the risks (identification, likelihood, consequences if realized)

‚Äì Due care pertains to acting responsibly and ‚Äúdoing the right thing.‚Äù
It is a legal term that defines the standards of performance that can be expected
due care intends to set a minimum necessary standard of care to be employed by an organization
The lack of due care is often considered negligence, and in most countries is actionable under law. If an organization is legally mandated to comply with regulations or information security requirements knowingly or unknowingly neglecting those requirements could lead to legal exposure from a due care perspective.
This is something I would do for my company ensuring we follow the rules/regulations and best practices.
Due Care is doing what a reasonable person would do about those risks

TOGAF (The Open Group Architecture Framework)
TOGAF is a framework for enterprise architecture that provides an approach for designing, planning, implementing, and governing an enterprise information technology architecture.
TOGAF is a high level approach to design
It is typically modeled at four levels: Business, Application, Data, and Technology. It relies heavily on modularization, standardization, and already existing, proven technologies and products.

Virtualization sprawl (VM sprawl) :
Virtualization sprawl is a phenomenon that occurs when the number of virtual machines (VMs) on a network reaches a point where the administrator can no longer manage them effectively
To prevent virtualization sprawl, the administrator should define and enforce a process for the deployment of VMs and create a library of standardized VM image files

Erasure coding :
RAID with parity (like RAID 5) and erasure coding improve data availability and safety. They enrich the original with redundancy data and spread it across disks. A subset of this data is enough to regenerate the original data. RAID is used for redundant storage of entire disks within a server. Erasure coding is usually used in distributed storage systems. So you can think of erasure coding as generalized and distributed RAID
Erasure coding is a method of data protection in which data is broken into fragments that are expanded and encoded with a configurable number of redundant pieces of data and stored across different locations, such as disks, storage nodes or geographical locations.
Erasure coding allows for the failure of two or more elements of a storage array and so offers more protection than Raid as commonly deployed.
Erasure coding is also found in the context of object storage, with very large-volume cloud operators
Erasure coding is a good option for latency tolerant, large capacity stores

Tokenization (data security) is the process of substituting a sensitive data element with a non-sensitive equivalent, referred to as a token, that has no extrinsic or exploitable meaning or value.
The token is a reference (i.e. identifier) that maps back to the sensitive data through a tokenization system.
The tokenization system must be secured and validated using security best practices
Only the tokenization system can tokenize data to create tokens, or detokenize back to redeem sensitive data under strict security controls
Tokenization systems may be operated in-house within a secure isolated segment of the data center, or as a service from a secure service provider.
The choice of tokenization as an alternative to other techniques such as encryption will depend on varying regulatory requirements, interpretation, and acceptance by respective auditing or assessment entities
Example of use : The PCI Council defines tokenization as ‚Äúa process by which the primary account number (PAN) is replaced with a surrogate value called a token
Source : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokenization_(data_security)

Data Masking = Data obfuscation = Data anonymisation

Static Data Masking (SDM): permanently replaces sensitive data by altering data at rest.
SDM is primarily used to provide high quality (i.e., realistic) data for development and testing of applications without disclosing sensitive information.
Additional uses include protecting data for use in analytics and training as well as facilitating compliance with standards and regulations (such as GDPR, PCI, HIPAA) that require limits on the use of data that identifies individuals.
SDM also facilitates cloud adoption because DevOps workloads are among the first that organizations migrate to the cloud. Masking data on premises prior to uploading it to the cloud reduces risk for organizations concerned with cloud-based data disclosure.

Dynamic Data Masking (DDM) : aims to replace sensitive data in transit leaving the original at-rest data intact and unaltered
DDM is primarily used to apply role-based (object-level) security for databases/applications.
In practice, the complexities involved in preventing masked data from being written back to the database essentially mean DDM should only be applied in read-only contexts such as reporting or customer service inquiry functions.
Not well suited for use in a dynamic (read/write) environment such as an enterprise application because masked data could be written back to the database, corrupting the data.

Source : https://www.imperva.com/blog/2017/07/static-versus-dynamic-data-masking/

Technics for Datamasking :
‚Äì Substitution is one of the most effective methods of applying data masking and being able to preserve the authentic look and feel of the data records.
‚Äì Shuffling method is a very common form of data obfuscation. the data is randomly shuffled
‚Äì Numeric variance method is very useful for applying to financial and date driven information fields
‚Äì Encryption is often the most complex approach to solving the data masking problem
‚Äì Nulling out or deletion
‚Äì Masking out : Character scrambling or masking out of certain fields is also another simplistic yet very effective method. This system is not very effective for test systems but is very useful for the billing scenario detailed above. It is also commonly known as a dynamic data masking method

Data masking invariably becomes the part of these processes in SDLC as the development environments‚Äô SLAs are usually not as stringent as the production environments‚Äô SLAs regardless of whether application is hosted in the cloud or on-premises.

Direct Identifiers / indirect Identifiers

Information that is sufficient on its own to identify an individual includes a person‚Äôs full name, social security number, email address containing the personal name, and biometric identifiers such as fingerprints, facial image, voice patterns, hand geometry, iris scan, or manual signature.
This type of data are often called direct identifiers.

Other information that may be used to fairly easily identify an individual include a person‚Äôs postal address, phone number, vehicle registration number, bibliographic citation to publications, email address not in the form of the personal name, web address to a web page containing personal data, unusual job title, rare disease, position held by only one person at a time (e.g. chairperson in an voluntary organization).
The Finnish Social Science Data Archive calls this type of data strong indirect identifiers.
The data archive also counts as strong indirect identifiers the types of codes that can be used to unequivocally identify an individual from among a group of individuals. These include, for instance, student ID number, insurance or bank account number, or IP address of a computer etc.

Cryptographic Bit splitting (aka cryptographic data splitting)
The technique involves encrypting data, splitting the encrypted data into smaller data units, distributing those smaller units to different storage locations, and then further encrypting the data at its new location
One application of cryptographic splitting is to provide security for cloud computing. The encrypted data subsets can be stored on different clouds, with the information required to restore the data being held on a private cloud for additional security

Data Discovery techniques
Data discovery is not a tool. It is a business user oriented process for detecting patterns and outliers by visually navigating data or applying guided advanced analytics.
Automated data discovery methods like data loss prevention (DLP) tools can help, as can open source tools designed to find certain kinds of regulated data (for example, the open source ccsrch tool that finds and flags credit card information)
Application inventories are a required part of HIPAA and PCI DSS compliance activities and can be directly leveraged to find areas of regulated information at a service provider.

The Smurf attack is a distributed denial-of-service attack in which large numbers of Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) packets with the intended victim‚Äôs spoofed source IP are broadcast to a computer network using an IP broadcast address. Most devices on a network will, by default, respond to this by sending a reply to the source IP address. If the number of machines on the network that receive and respond to these packets is very large, the victim‚Äôs computer will be flooded with traffic.
source : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smurf_attack

A variation to the Smurf attack is the Fraggle attack. The attack is essentially the same as the Smurf attack but instead of sending an ICMP echo request to the direct broadcast address, it sends UDP packets.

Plenum : in building construction, a plenum (pronounced PLEH-nuhm, from Latin meaning full) is a separate space provided for air circulation for heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning (sometimes referred to as HVAC) and typically provided in the space between the structural ceiling and a drop-down ceiling

Temperature and humidity levels in accordance with American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air-conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) guidelines

Temperature range is typically between 18 degrees Celsius to 27 degrees
(64.4 degrees to 80.6 degrees Fahrenheit); (ASHRAE 67 -> 82)

Humidity is measured by Relative Humidity Percentage Non-Condensing
with the current range between 40% and 55% (60% in ISC2 book) (ASHRAE 65%)

Uptime Institute‚Äôs Tier Classification System for data centers
https://journal.uptimeinstitute.com/explaining-uptime-institutes-tier-classification-system/

Tier I : Basic capacity -> UPS, generator, dedicated cooling equipment
Tier II : Redundant capacity components -> includes redundant critical power and cooling components. The redundant components include power and cooling equipment such as UPS modules, chillers or pumps, and engine generators.
Chiller : machine that removes heat from a liquid via a vapor-compression or absorption refrigeration cycle. This liquid can then be circulated through a heat exchanger to cool equipment, or another process stream
Tier III : Concurrently Maintainable -> requires no shutdowns for equipment replacement and maintenance. A redundant delivery path for power and cooling is added to the redundant critical components of Tier II
Tier IV: Fault Tolerance -> adding the concept of Fault Tolerance to the site infrastructure topology

The Tier Classification System does not prescribe specific technology or design criteria beyond those stated above
Tier Certification is a performance based evaluation of a data center‚Äôs specific infrastructure, and not a checklist or cookbook

‚Äî BCDR

BCDR (Business Continuity / Disaster Recovery)

Event : any unscheduled adverse impact to the operating environment
An event is distinguished from a disaster by the duration of impact
we consider an event‚Äôs impact to last 3 days or less. A disaster‚Äôs impact lasts longer

The paramount importance in BC/DR planning and efforts should be health and human safety, as in all security matters

MAD : Maximum Allowable Downtime
RTO : Recovery Time Objective
RPO : Recovery Point Objective

For all datacenters, a minimum of at least 12 hours of fuel for all generators

For BCDR purposes, the plan should anticipate at least 72 hours of generator operation before other alternative are available

BCDR testing methodology
‚Äì Tabletop testing : essential participants, a sort of role-playing game
No impact on production
‚Äì Dry Run : whole organization take part in a scenario at a scheduled time but without performing the tasks in real
More impact on productivity than Tabletop
‚Äì Full Test : Entire organization takes part in an unscheduled, unannounced practice scenario

PII : Personally Identifiable Information
PLA : Privacy Level Agreement

ISO/IEC 27018 Code of Practice for Protecting Personal Data in the Cloud
https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/trustcenter/compliance/iso-iec-27018

Privacy
the data controller (typically the entity that has the primary relationship with an
individual) is prohibited from collecting and processing personal data unless certain criteria are met.
These laws define numerous obligations, such as confidentiality and security obligations, for theentities that access personal data.
Many countries prohibit or restrict the transfer of information out of their borders. In most cases, the transfer is permitted only if the country to which the data is transferred offers an ‚Äúadequate level of protection‚Äù (as defined in the relevant national law) of personal information and privacy rights of affected individuals.

PII : Personally Identifiable Information

Data Subject : individual who the PII refers to
Data Controller, Cloud Customer, Data Owner : any entity collecting or creating PII
Data Processor, Cloud Provider, Data Custodian: any entity acting on behalf or at the behest of the Data Controller

Data Controller is ultimately responsible for any unauthorized disclosure of PII

EU Network Information Security Directive (NIS Directive) :
The NIS Directive entered into force in August 2016, requiring each EU/EEA member state to implement the Directive into its national legislation by May 2018.

Difference between a Regulation, Directive and Decision in Europe:
‚Äì Regulations have binding legal force throughout every Member State and enter into force on a set date in all the Member States
‚Äì Directives lay down certain results that must be achieved but each Member State is free to decide how to transpose directives into national laws
‚Äì Decisions are EU laws relating to specific cases and directed to individual or several Member States, companies or private individuals. They are binding upon those to whom they are directed.

‚Äî GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation)
The European Union (EU) adopted the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in 2016, which is binding on all EU member states, as well as members of the European Economic Area (EEA).
The GDPR will become enforceable as of May 25, 2018. On that date, Directive 95/46/EC on the Protection of Personal Data, which had been the legal basis of the provisions of the national data protection laws of all EU and EEA member states, will be repealed.
From a security standpoint, the Network Information Security Directive (NIS Directive) is paving the way to more stringent security requirements. Adopted in 2016, the NIS Directive requires EU/EEA member states to implement new information security laws for the protection of critical infrastructure and essential services by May 2018
General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)
The new GDPR is directly binding on any corporation that processes the data of EU citizens
Breaches of Security: The GDPR requires companies to report that they have suffered a breach of security. The reporting requirements are risk-based, and there are different requirements for reporting the breach to the Supervisory Authority and to the affected data subjects. Breaches must be reported within 72 hours of the company becoming aware of the incident.
Sanctions: Violations of the GDPR expose a company to significant sanctions. These sanctions may reach up to the greater of 4% of their global turnover or gross income, or up to EUR 20 million.

To be able to demonstrate compliance with the GDPR, the data controller should implement measures, which meet the principles of data protection by design and data protection by default. Privacy by design and by default (Article 25) require data protection measures to be designed into the development of business processes for products and services. Such measures include pseudonymising personal data, by the controller, as soon as possible (Recital 78).

Each member state will establish an independent supervisory authority (SA) to hear and investigate complaints, sanction administrative offenses, etc
GDPR : severe penalties of up to 4% of worldwide turnover or ‚Ç¨20 million

Pseudonymisation : The GDPR refers to pseudonymisation as a process that is required when data are stored (as an alternative to the other option of complete data anonymization)[26] to transform personal data in such a way that the resulting data cannot be attributed to a specific data subject without the use of additional information

A right to be forgotten was replaced by a more limited right of erasure in the version of the GDPR that was adopted by the European Parliament in March 2014.

‚Äî‚Äî SOC, SSAE16

AICPA : American Institute of Certified Public Accountants

Cloud provider generally don‚Äôt want to share a detailed audit of security controls for the same reason they don‚Äôt want to allow physical access.
Instead the provider is likely to publish an audit assurance statement. A kind of seal of approval
Currently this usually takes the form of an SOC 3 Audit report.

SOC : Service Organization Control

Example : Microsoft has achieved SOC 1 Type 2, SOC 2 Type 2, and SOC 3 reports. In
general, the availability of SOC 1 and SOC 2 reports is restricted to customers
who have signed nondisclosure agreements with Microsoft; the SOC 3 report is
publicly available (http://aka.ms/soc3)

SOC reports are a part of the SSAE reporting format created by the AICPA
SSAE 16 : Statement on Standards for Attestation Engagements

SOC 1 report are strictly for auditing the financial reporting instruments of a corporation
SOC 2 report are intended to report audit of any controls on an organization security
SOC 2 Type 1 : review the design of controls not how they are implemented and maintained or their function
SOC 2 Type 2 : is extremely detailed and provides information about configuration and implementation
Cloud provider are trying to restrict this document from wide dissemination
SOC 3 is the seal of approval : it contains no actual data about the security controls of the audit target and is just an assertion that the audit was conduct and that the target company passed

‚Äî- Cloud Security Alliance (CSA) Certifications

CSA STAR Program
http://cloudsecurityalliance.org/star
https://cloudsecurityalliance.org/star/#_overview

CSA STAR is the industry‚Äôs most powerful program for security assurance in the cloud. STAR encompasses key principles of transparency, rigorous auditing, and harmonization of standards.

STAR consists of three levels of assurance, which currently cover four unique offerings all based upon a succinct yet comprehensive list of cloud-centric control objectives in the CSA‚Äôs Cloud Controls Matrix (CCM)

LEVEL 3 (Continuous Monitoring based certification)
CSA STAR Continuous Monitoring
LEVEL 2 (3rd party assessment based Certification) :
CSA STAR Certification : rigorous third-party independent assessment of the security of a cloud service provider. The technology-neutral certification leverages the requirements of the ISO/IEC 27001:2005 management system standard together with the CSA Cloud Controls Matrix.
CSA STAR Attestation : is a collaboration between CSA and the AICPA to provide guidelines for CPAs to conduct SOC 2 engagements using criteria from the AICPA (Trust Service Principles, AT 101) and the CSA Cloud Controls Matrix. STAR Attestation provides for rigorous third party independent assessments of cloud providers.
CSA C-START Assessment : robust third party independent assessment of the security of a cloud service provider for the Greater China market that harmonizes CSA best practices with Chinese national standards.
LEVEL 1 : CSA STAR Self-Assessment

‚Äî Common Criteria Evaluation

EAL : Evaluation Assurance Level
The Evaluation Assurance Level (EAL1 through EAL7) of an IT product or system is a numerical grade assigned following the completion of a Common Criteria security evaluation, an international standard in effect since 1999. The increasing assurance levels reflect added assurance requirements that must be met to achieve Common Criteria certification
The EAL level does not measure the security of the system itself, it simply states at what level the system was tested.
To achieve a particular EAL, the computer system must meet specific assurance requirements. Most of these requirements involve design documentation, design analysis, functional testing, or penetration testing.
TOE : Target of Evaluation
Assurance levels :
‚Äì EAL1: Functionally Tested
‚Äì EAL2: Structurally Tested
‚Äì EAL3: Methodically Tested and Checked
‚Äì EAL4: Methodically Designed, Tested and Reviewed ‚Äì> EAL4 is the highest level at which it is likely to be economically feasible to retrofit to an existing product line
‚Äì EAL5: Semi formally Designed and Tested
‚Äì EAL6: Semi formally Verified Design and Tested
‚Äì EAL7: Formally Verified Design and Tested ‚Äì> applicable to the development of security TOEs for application in extremely high risk situations and/or where the high value of the assets justifies the higher costs.

AZ-302 Microsoft Azure Solutions Architect Certification Transition ðŸ™‚

[Update : 30th of january â€“ what as been removed from preview exam]
[Update : 22th of february 19 : AZ 302 Exam includes now some hands on labs with an Azure Portal !!! be carefull with your keyboard if it not an QWERTY US Layout !! ]

Before starting studying, you must know very well what this certification is about and what are the prerequisites

This exam is intended only for those candidates who have taken exam 70-535 (Architecting Microsoft Azure Solutions). This will provide an upgrade path to earn the new Azure Solution Architect certification.

This transition exam tests and validates the skills and objective areas that are covered on the AZ-300 and AZ-301 exams, 
but are not covered on the older 70-535 exam.

The topics included in this transition exam are the following :

Develop for the Cloud (45-50%)
Implement Authentication and Secure Data (5-10%)
Implement Workloads and Security (5-10%)
Design a Business Continuity Strategy (15-20%)
Design for Identity and Security (5-10%)
Determine Workload Requirements (15-20%)
More details : https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/learning/exam-az-302.aspx

Important : following the preview phase of this certification, few changes have been done to make the exam more an architect exam than a developer exam (there was a lot of C# code to read in preview). So donâ€™t spend to much time reading my slides that include C#).

All updates of the certification are explained in the following Microsoft official document : https://query.prod.cms.rt.microsoft.com/cms/api/am/binary/RE2MRod so READ IT.

Following are my preparation notes and urls to documentation you MUST READ to well prepare your exam.
